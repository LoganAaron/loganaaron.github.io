Hey there! Im Logan Peterson, a designer who lives to create. I make logos, illustrations, web pages, applications, as well as write songs and produce music. I live in Omaha, Nebraska where Ive been making art since I was old enough to hold a crayon. Ive transferred my creative drive into the digital realm; with an iMac, hard work, and a passion for my craft(s).
