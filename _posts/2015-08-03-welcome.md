Hey there. My name is Logan, but you probably already figured that out by now. Im going to use this blog as a way to log my journey into the world of web design & development.
I started the journey some time last spring where I took a week long web basics course.  I quickly realized I cant afford traditional education and sought out online resources. The great thing about the web is that its a self sustaining organism. It has all the resources necessary to keep it running.
Information is free if you know where to look. Check out my resources page for some ways to go about that.
Im creating this for myself and if someone out there gets a benefit then thats a plus. Im just finding it harder the older I get to keep track of everything mentally.
