So Im trying to learn the ins and outs of scalable vector graphics. SVG is gaining a lot of popularity these days with the focus on optimizing page loads for mobile. With the small file sizes and animation capabilities, as well as many more wonderful things you can do with this tool, its future looks promising. I plan on doing one cool thing per letter of the alphabet. I figure this will be a fun little project to get more comfortable with animations, and explore all the cool things you can do with SVG.
